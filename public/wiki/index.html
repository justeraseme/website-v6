    <h1>Tanto's Wiki</h1>
    <p>
        A long time ago, I had the idea of making my own personal wiki. I wanted to document some cool stuff somewhere. Now, building an entire wiki and maintaining it? Pain in the ass. So why not just make a page for myself as though every Minecraft server had a wiki?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, what a great idea! At least that's what I thought, before my own wiki page for myself got deleted on Minecraft server's wiki ...<br>
        So in spite, I made one myself. And extended that to my OCs.
