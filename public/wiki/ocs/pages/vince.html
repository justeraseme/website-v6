            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Angelica (Adopted Daughter)</dt>
              <dd>Adopted some time in 2019 when Vince was still fresh out of High School, Angelica was Vince's only adoptive family member. She disappeared some time around 2020 when Vince was seeing Marcus, and he's been looking for her since.</dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Matthew (Brother)</dt>
              <dd>Matt and Vince have a distant but good relationship, as they were the two that saw each other the most.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Tonya (Sister)</dt>
              <dd>Vince was more closer to Tonya and saw her as a mentor in his teenhood, however since has just let her do her own thing alone.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Nevaeh (Mother)</dt>
              <dd>Vince was very close to his mother and loved her the most, although she would pass unexpectedly around when Vince was just wrapping up High School for unknown reasons.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">James (Father)</dt>
              <dd>James and Vince were not that close in childhood. With the arguing and all the disagreements with his wife, Vince was not very close to James. They both sparred a lot when the Lost Earth hunting company was initially doing rounds, although they now no longer talk to each other or meet, at all.</dd>
          </dl>
              
          <h4>FRIENDS</h4>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Tyler</dt>
              <dd>Ty is Vince's closest friend. They grew up together over XBOX and played Call of Duty as kids after school. They seem like a solid duo.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Marcus</dt>
              <dd>As ironic as it is to pair a rabbit and a wolf, they get along just fine. Boundaries are understood, and since they're both a part of Ty's friend group anyway, they actually grew to enjoy each other's company.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Fox</dt>
              <dd>Vince and Fox are not very close as Vince felt reminded by an old friend when he looks at Fox, although there's no bad blood. They hang out just fine.</dd>
          </dl>

            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Phillip</dt>
              <dd>Phil is Vince's favorite high school kid. He provided the driving and truck that Vince got his first Vandalism charges in.</dd>
            </dl>

          <h4>NEUTRAL</h4>
            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Li</dt>
              <dd>Vince doesn't know Li very well, but can only assume that they have good intentions. They first met during an explorer's raid on a ViziaTech facility, where Jackal was meant to be put down.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">August</dt>
              <dd>Vince sympathizes with August and her own struggles, although cannot connect as deeply as he was a bitten wolf, and not a born one. Regardless, they both get along fine but don't reach out to each other unless if it's a favor, as the age gap is too big.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Haley</dt>
              <dd>Vince and Haley have a similar relationship, but where Haley is Human, Vince mostly just drives her places when August can't.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Michael (Deceased)</dt>
              <dd>Vince doesn't really know what the deal with Michael is, as he doesn't know Michael's life very well, although in the time that Michael lived, Vince considered him to be alright.</dd>
            </dl>
              
          <h4>ENEMIES</h4>

          <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Landfall Arms</dt>
              <dd>Given that the soldiers that hunted him are dead, and the company that was funded to replace the hunters are gone, his final target is towards the arms company that enabled the fighting in the first place. Just to do so without a big ruckus is the next problem...</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">"Jackal" (Deceased)</dt>
              <dd>In the long time that Vince got to be familiar with Jackal, he fucking hates this guy. The Jackal is very egotistic, was obsessed with kidnapping Vince and loved to send soldiers his way, which he had to deal with by force along with his daughter, who was far too young to deal with this kind of stuff.<br>
              Jackal died in a ViziaTech facility raid a few weeks after the bankrupcy of VT, being plummetted by Vince himself.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Edward (Deceased)</dt>
              <dd>Considering that Edward funded VT and literally ordered his death after Jackal had to pay VT... Yeah, he hats this guy too. Luckily, Edward would get what he deserves following a ViziaTech spar, which would lead to the bankrupcy of the parent company.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">Jared (Deceased)</dt>
              <dd>Vince wasn't very familiar with Jared as his brother Jackal did all the work, however Vince still felt animosity towards Jared as he also enabled the conflict and also wanted some of the cash for Vince's death reward. Jared disappeared and was confirmed killed by 2023, to unknown circumstances.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
              <dt><img src="images/no-icon.png" class="icon">ViziaTech (Bankrupt)</dt>
              <dd>ViziaTech experimented on Vince's friends multiple times, tried to kidnap him several times and hooked him up to a hate machine some time in 2025. Of course he fucking hates them. Luckily, they're gone.</dd>

              <li>Vince was originally created to mirror my IRL personality, to an extreme degree. Since 2022, Vince deviated from that goal in favor for fantasy elements.</li>
              <li>Vince was created some time in 2018/2019 for the purpose of entering a City Life ROBLOX Roleplay game. Since then, Vince was expanded to be one of my main cast.</li>
              <li>Vince was originally human, before being turned into a wolf around Summer 2019.</li>
              <li>Some of Vince's favorite artists includes Swans, Metallica, Pink Floyd and Black Stone Cherry.</li>
              <li>Whitehall is modelled after the setting of the old roleplay game RoCitizens, which was a ROBLOX game I loved a lot.</li>
