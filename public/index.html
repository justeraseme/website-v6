        Hello! Before you can pass through this site, we need to get over some essentials.
         <br><br>
        Firstly, this website is best viewed on a 1920x1080 PC screen, as that's what it was designed most for. Mobile may work, but is not properly tested. Proceed at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Mature Content Warning</h2>

    <p>
        This site may contain <b>direct mentions</b> and/or <b>discussions about certain taboo topics</b> that may or may not make some uncomfortable. A small list of those topics include drug usage, mature themes (anything extreme will be properly marked) and societal struggles (minor, not scarring). Heavy content is properly marked for the comfort of internet surfers.<br><br>

        There may occasionally be mentions of cannabis, which I can legally possess and use in the amounts I own, <b>especially in the journal/posts section</b>. Your laws may vary.<br><br>

        Additionally, if you venture into the original characters section, you should tread lightly, as there are mentions and themes of family abuse, heavy drug use and heavy violence. You will be required to click an extra amount of times to see sentisive content.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Turn off your adblocker</h2>

    <p>
        If you feel you can continue, feel free to. <b>It is highly recommended to turn off your content blocker</b> as various elements of the site (like timestamps on /posts/) rely on Javascript, and may be blocked if you have a particularly sensitive ad blocker or any other kind of content blocker. NoScript and uBlock Origin in Super Strict mode tend to do this the most.
        <br><br>
        Please make an exception for this page or turn the blocker OFF while you browse. There are no ads, promise!
    </p>

    <h2>Art used is not mine / AI was not used in the creation of my content</h2>

    <p>
        Any art used on this page, with the exception of the HTML and the ownership of my characters, is not owned by me, nor endorsed by the original artists. The pixel art used for the branding of the site is owned by <a href="https://nomnomnami.com">NomNomNami</a>, as well as the character. Please check out her work!
        <br><br>
        Additionally, no AI created artistic content is used on this website, including a strict promise of <b>no AI created art, music or otherwise</b>. Code snippets are used however, but avoided where possible unless it adds something. (i.e: Music widget)<br>
        <b>Human created content</b> is always prioritized and is credited where possible.
