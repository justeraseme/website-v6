            <p>
                I'm just so surprised that out of all ways to end my year, the thing that's going to end my year is an obsession with a song created by somebody in the MLP fandom. An album that literally has near zero ties to MLP, apart from being a maybe loosely based fanfiction? I guess?
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe it's just that it hits home for me. I'm not sure. But "Revenge Fantasy" is probably one of the most attaching songs I've ever heard. It's a great duality between subtle and out there. The intro is something I can't stop listening to...
            </p>

            <p>
                The album's story elements didn't really hit me as hard as it did before (maybe because I didn't read the novella along with it), though this album has quickly made an impact on me. Maybe I just feel parelells to some of the song's themes, as somebody who's intrusively had a messy, negative mindset towards myself and how I've kind of connected the album's theme of Trauma to something I can get attached to?
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not sure. It won't easy be to just say "this album is really good, pick it up!" because it has like a thousand content warnings and some of the songs are pretty far from easy to stomach... But regardless. It's a song I hold close to me right now. Maybe I'm just addicted to what the songs on this album make me feel.

                I wrapped up the album and doing some QA stuff. I sent a copy over to some friends and just waiting to see if any polishes need to be made before it's officially released. I can share more details soon :)

                what am i doing, updating my site? i should be wrapping up the album, it's like a few tweaks away from QA then release...

            <p>
                I'm really happy to finally have my album wrapped up, it has been 8 months of development. Every three months, the album got another rework and it went through so many names. It's going to be out very soon and I don't know how I'll distribute it yet. It will probably be on Google Drive or something, I'm too anxious to post to YouTube yet, I think.
            </p>

            <p>
                But this <i>is</i> at least new development. It's been a long cycle and I've tried again and again to make the album work. The album went through so many tracklists.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't know when I'll release it for sure. Probably some time in mid or late December. I originally planned to bundle writing with the release, but I don't have the time or confidence for that, it seems.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I do know is it's time to hang a new, beautiful start. I taught myself to remix and create. I'll create, as long as I can.
            </p>

            <p>
                And maybe some day, we'll all be free. And we won't miss some things anymore.

                <p>
                out of curiosity, i picked up monarch of monsters, not really sure what to expect. maybe at first i expected something like when snakes sing, the rock project of an aussie furry that while pretty good, did kind of lack in the mixing area.
            </p>

            <p>
                god, no the FUCK this is not like wss.

            <details class="readmore">
            <summary>(18+) read more</summary>
            <p>
                i've read about the album top to bottom. skimmed a bit through the novella that came with the album out of curiosity, looked at some of the visuals created for all the songs, read about the album history, etc... most of the album's direction came after the creator (a brony btw) had a dream about a god turning into somebody they hurt in their past, i think. that kind of makes it hit harder tbh, but i have my own struggles, so the album reached me in my own way.
            </p>

            <p>
                oh, and by the way, this shit hits you HARD. i was pretty high on my first listen, though i was crying halfway through the song. i've been in a lot of pretty fucked up positions, so this album kind of just spoke to me in a way that no other album really did. it really makes you think about yourself... and that's just what makes it amazing.
            </p>

            <p>
                the only problem is that the artwork is softcore... actually, i won't finish that.
