            <p>shower thought, is call of duty 2 (2005) a sequel to the original, ORIGINAL 2003 call of duty game?</p>
            <details class="readmore">
            <summary>read more (spoiler warning)</summary>
            <p>like for example in call of duty 2003, we rescued captain price from that compound campsite thing, while playing as a completely different american person. but in call of duty 2 we play on the british side (directly after the soviet campaign), and price is back.</p>
            <p>are the games connected??? or is this just a crazy conspiracy theory</p>

            <p>i think it would be so funny if there was a mod out there for minecraft, that alters how the food system works.</p>
            <p>like imagine instead of cooking it completely after x seconds in the furnace, make it cook at a %. first 20%, still raw meat. 30-60%? lightly cooked meat. 70-99% is kinda cooked meat and then 100% gives you the vanilla cooked food.</p>
            <p>also imagine if raw food had a 100% chance to poison you. but cooking it more reduces that percent until it reaches 0!!! amazing right</p>
            <p>somebody probably thought my idea was weird but honestly i think it was genius</p>

            <p>high me sabotaging clear me by joining either the most deadest or the most hardest modded servers is incredibly funny but also incredibly sad</p>
            <p>like there was clearly no malice intended but somehow i just unironically picked the hardest servers for myself while high. once again a reason why the minecraft scene is fucked up!</p>
            <p>anyway, i made a tag for myself when i get stoned. and i'm probably not going to use it for a while because i want to take a long break again</p>

            <p>actually, let's expand MORE on this. i want to shame everybody equally here</p>
            <details class="readmore">
            <summary>read more</summary>
            <p>first, let's put the people with 20+ age limits on the board.</p>
            <p><b>yes</b>, it is dumb to tell grown ass adults that they shouldn't be welcome to play a game with other fellow adults. it is <b>also</b> dumb to say that adults cannot put together a server for other adults, and not want kids around.</p>
            <p>where <B>I</B> draw the line is how these servers are fucking EVERYWHERE. 18+, 21+, 20+, 30+, fucking 50+ is going to become a new norm at some point, i swear to god. i saw at one point a server for 40+ people. <b>i am 19</b>. i was looking for servers appropiate for a 13 y/o. A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD. HELLO?</p>
            <p>you see the same shit everywhere too. if i downvoted every server i ever already visited, i'd see a "[-1]" on almost every ad. so many servers at once repost every day(!!!) about their server that i see the same shit every time. i always see the same lore, geopolitical, faction, hub, lgbtq friendly and "not p2w" bullshit ALL the fucking time. EVERYWHERE. IT'S FUCKING EVERYWHERE.</p>
            <p>i think i dare say that the server hunting space is literally insanely toxic because there's almost nothing for a 13 year old to enter. 13 year olds get fucked over and people like me have to sift through a bunch of junk to find the right one, and even when i DO find the right one the fun dies immediately because they were too lazy to add one more plugin or the community is just dead fucking silent!!!</p>

            <p>in lighter news, i find it both incredibly depressing and incredibly entertaining that the minecraft server hunting experience is so fucking conflicting (and in itself, shit and annoying)!</p>
            <details class="readmore">
            <summary>read more</summary>
            <p>like what do you mean at best i'll find a dream server that gives me /nick and has a loving community but either i get bored in 5 days because i bought what i need at shopping district, *OR* they left chat reports on with no way to get around it?</p>
            <p>and what do you <b>MEAN</b> the worst case scenario is an obnoxious hub world with ah, crates, voting, an anti-cheat that stops you in place if you anti-hunger and a cash economy? what do you <i>mean</i> the average server will have claims, towny, factions, blocked /plugins and a dead chat that almost never answers you unless you somehow are socialization jesus and/or join for the first time? <b>WHAT DO YOU MEAN</b> SOMETIMES THE HELLO WHEN YOU FIRST JOIN IS NOT GUARENTEED???</p>
            <p>no, actually. i started leaving servers because so many of them are SO GOD DAMN SHIT. i just left one because they started whitelisting people <i>ahead</i> of me, while i had to sit in the dust with others! i left another server because they started adding client-required mods and i'd rather play full on modpacks for that, not a server with like a single required mod that would make little difference if they just ran the server with it off...</p>
            <p>coming from somebody who signs up for minecraft servers in waves btw. like i'll actually join more than 2 at a time and then if i have a comfortable amount of servers, i'll slowly go down the ladder one by one until i find a nice server i can stay in for a while. while doing a million checks each server, checking commands for ones that signal shit server, checking chat reports etc</p>

            <p>the charlie kirk drama like really started to show a lot of people's true colors on the internet.</p>
            <details class="readmore">
            <summary>read more</summary>
            <p>like holy shit, it sparked a lot of drama between people and some people seem to genuinely be going on frenzies over it</p>
            <p>when it comes to where i stand, i agree with the sentiments that celebrating a human life being taken away is immoral and people have taken a few things out of context, but that doesn't really excuse kirk's actions either?</p>
            <p>i heard a good few points from people who say the death wasn't to be celebrated with points like his family, a lot of his points being taken out of context (i've read some of the supposed full quotes and yeah, they were taken way out of context)... but then there's also the fact that kirk believed that trans people could learn to love their bodies as they were... from what i read, it at least sounded like he wasn't pushy about it, but that kind of thing is not really something that screams "i support people who are questioning their identity", does it?</p>
            <p>i'm not really going to deny the fact that he probably <i>was</i> a nazi but i'm not engaging in all of this debating over it. my block list is probably going to skyrocket from now</p>
