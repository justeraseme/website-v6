                reviewing my top 30 albums in terms of playtimes to end 2025 would be so fun... but i really want to wrap up my vylet pony adventures and rereviews :(
            </p>

            <p>
                i'll wrap up the vylet pony albums i wanted to try and then we do the legendary 30 run!

                a friend i know really likes cynthoni (to the point of listening to a lot of their stuff almost exclusively, along with other breakcore i think) saw how much i have been obsessed with vylet pony's monarch songs lately and said to me "you're experiencing what i went through when i found out about cyn"

            <p>
                the terror i feel knowing i am now obligated to make it my personality. oh god this is gonna overtake me isnt it

                i think i might become a vylet pony fan

            <p>
                given that i popped in monarch of monsters for fun, and i'm now picking up loner of paradise valley... oh god there's a trend coming up behind me with a bat, isn't there? this will become my music personality for the next few weeks like when kanye made waves in 2023 OH GOD.

                It's incredibly funny, yet incredibly sad what the PS3 port of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is like. The animation interpolation sucks, the animations look like rubber... When you play Multiplayer, it's a mismatch of 60FPS and like, GTA 4 levels of performance (bad). Good thing Zombies is capped to 30...
            </p>

            <p>
                Oh yeah, and I hope your PSN account is from 2018 or earlier (and/or never had a name change)! Really though, there's conflicting information so I'm not sure if there's more to it, but allegedly, if you never played Black Ops 3 on an old PSN account, you cannot enter multiplayer. At all. Weird shit...
            </p>

            <p>
                Not to mention, it's basically out of support. 2 DLCs and nothing... For those who don't know, you get Awakening and The Giant. Which gives you four multiplayer maps (one being a remake) and two Zombie maps. Okay, cool...
            </p>

            <p>
                What an awful port...

            <p>
                I'm just so surprised that out of all ways to end my year, the thing that's going to end my year is an obsession with a song created by somebody in the MLP fandom. An album that literally has near zero ties to MLP, apart from being a maybe loosely based fanfiction? I guess?
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe it's just that it hits home for me. I'm not sure. But "Revenge Fantasy" is probably one of the most attaching songs I've ever heard. It's a great duality between subtle and out there. The intro is something I can't stop listening to...
            </p>

            <p>
                The album's story elements didn't really hit me as hard as it did before (maybe because I didn't read the novella along with it), though this album has quickly made an impact on me. Maybe I just feel parelells to some of the song's themes, as somebody who's intrusively had a messy, negative mindset towards myself and how I've kind of connected the album's theme of Trauma to something I can get attached to?
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not sure. It won't easy be to just say "this album is really good, pick it up!" because it has like a thousand content warnings and some of the songs are pretty far from easy to stomach... But regardless. It's a song I hold close to me right now. Maybe I'm just addicted to what the songs on this album make me feel.

                I wrapped up the album and doing some QA stuff. I sent a copy over to some friends and just waiting to see if any polishes need to be made before it's officially released. I can share more details soon :)

            <p>
                I'm really happy to finally have my album wrapped up, it has been 8 months of development. Every three months, the album got another rework and it went through so many names. It's going to be out very soon and I don't know how I'll distribute it yet. It will probably be on Google Drive or something, I'm too anxious to post to YouTube yet, I think.
            </p>

            <p>
                But this <i>is</i> at least new development. It's been a long cycle and I've tried again and again to make the album work. The album went through so many tracklists.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't know when I'll release it for sure. Probably some time in mid or late December. I originally planned to bundle writing with the release, but I don't have the time or confidence for that, it seems.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I do know is it's time to hang a new, beautiful start. I taught myself to remix and create. I'll create, as long as I can.
            </p>

            <p>
                And maybe some day, we'll all be free. And we won't miss some things anymore.

                out of curiosity, i picked up monarch of monsters, not really sure what to expect. maybe at first i expected something like when snakes sing, the rock project of an aussie furry that while pretty good, did kind of lack in the mixing area.

                i've read about the album top to bottom. skimmed a bit through the novella that came with the album out of curiosity, looked at some of the visuals created for all the songs, read about the album history, etc... most of the album's direction came after the creator (a brony btw) had a dream about a god turning into somebody they hurt in their past, i think. that kind of makes it hit harder tbh, but i have my own struggles, so the album reached me in my own way.

                oh, and by the way, this shit hits you HARD. i was pretty high on my first listen, though i was crying halfway through the song. i've been in a lot of pretty fucked up positions, so this album kind of just spoke to me in a way that no other album really did. it really makes you think about yourself... and that's just what makes it amazing.

                the only problem is that the artwork is softcore... actually, i won't finish that.
