          <h1>Welcome to my own little personal website!</h1>

          <p>
            Frankly, a lot of social media is not for me. Twitter was quite filled with people who jump the train to call you out on the stupidest shit, Bluesky is the pride version, any good social media either dies quick or comes with caveats, and Tumblr...
            
            <br>
          
            Well, I think you can take your best swing at it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without any real good one place to stay (as well as wanting to divide all of my favorite stuff in one place, rather than disjoint it and create more complications), what is the one thing you can do to put all of your favorite things together..? A place to talk about your stuff, and not have to abide by the modern web's standards..?
          </p>

          <p>
            Oh hey, look, a community of indie web developers just fell from the sky!
