          <h1>TANTO AURA!</h1>

          <p>
            A personal website intended to (mostly) replace social media and serve a lot of personal content. Demos, original character info pages, tibits about me, a journal to post thoughts... If you can think of it, I probably considered putting it here at some point!
          </p>

          <p>
            Frankly, a lot of social media is not for me. Twitter was quite filled with people who jump the train to call you out on the stupidest shit, Bluesky is the pride version, any good social media either dies quick or comes with caveats, and Tumblr...
            
            <br>
          
            Well, I think you can take your best swing at it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I originally started out making a very scrappy website made out of the ashes of one of my friend's shitpost pages, and since then I have just been hoping to ideally, some time, create something that encapsulates all of my favorite interests! So here we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            In its current state, my website mainly is just my Twitter alternative, although soon I hope to document a lot of my Minecraft SMP experiences as well as a lot of other cool stuff I want to put out there! So hopefully some time that'll come together.
          </p>

          <p>Thanks for coming by!</p>

          <h2>Visit a friend!</h2>
          <p>None yet... :(</p>

            It's okay, sometimes I put cool websites on my "buttons" section on the right! You can always check those out!
