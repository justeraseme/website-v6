<p>Torishux, also known by their ingame name Shawtober, is a Season 1 member of Twilight Sancturary, most known for providing advice and suggestions for plugins on day one, and spending day two travelling to all four corners of the world borders, making tourist attractions there, when the world border was first at 6k.</p>

    <p>Torishux is (roughly) one of the ~8 out of 18 people to show up to Twilight Sancturary's Opening Day of Season 1.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
    Before the launch of the server, Torishux joined the Discord on October 11th 2025 and submitted their application the same day. Their application would end up being one of the more longer<sup>1</sup> and higher quality entries and would get accepted within an hour of submission.
</p>

<p>
    While Aure waited for the server to open, they played in other servers they were in at the time.
</p>

<h3>Launch Day</h3>
<p>
    On the day of the launch of the server, Torishux was one of the few people to join and participate in the server the moment it opened. They would be the fifth person to ever join.
</p>

<p>
    The server would be open for about twenty minutes before the server was restarted to fix chat reports being enabled. Torishux continued to stay in the server while contributing plugin ideas as well as other miscellaneous suggestions. Aure played on the server for another 3 and a half hours before eventually logging off for the night, making a base in the snow region and planting many cherry trees.
</p>

<h3>Day Two</h3>
<p>
    Most of Day Two was spent cleaning up the base. The base would later that day be found by player Dotiichu_, who would leave signs on the property with a fake Obama troll quote. This would later be cleaned up.
</p>

<h4>The Border Project</h4>
<p>
    Upon realizing that the world border was only 3k out (and therefore only about 1.5k from her base), Torishux spontaneously decided to visit all four corners of the world border, making platforms to leave signs and let players leave their mark before the world border expanded. Torishux later sent a screenshot to the official Discord, with the caption "1/4", with a picture of the South East border and some signs. (3:22)
</p>

<p>Torishux also made a Book & Quill to document their journeys, which would only make about three pages long. Aure reached the South West border almost an hour later, then reaching the North East border 30 minutes later. After another 40 minutes of travelling, they reached the Northwest border and wrapped up their journey, logging off at a Pale Oak garden to get saplings for a future new base.</p>

<h3>Post-Launch</h3>

<p>On October 22nd 2025, Torishux later revisited the South East border wall and expanded the area, adding more detailed signs. Torishux also privately marked a new spot near the border where she could build a new base. The project wouldn't go forward until later on.</p>
